# Description
The CLC program allows users to perform a variety of mathematical operations from the command line interface. It includes the following features:

+ Binary Mathematical Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power, maximum, and minimum.
+ Unary Mathematical Operations: Square root, logarithm, exponentiation, ceiling, and floor.
+ Advanced Mathematical Operations: These operations involve variables (a to e) and can be combined with binary or unary operations.
+ Variable Definition: Users can define and assign values to variables (a to e).
+ Loop Handling: The program handles invalid input gracefully and provides options for users to exit or continue.
+ User-Friendly Interface: The program guides users through the mathematical operations step by step.

# How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the desired operation and input values.

# Supported Operations
+ B (Binary Operations): Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), power (^), maximum (X), minimum (I).
+ U (Unary Operations): Square root (S), logarithm (L), exponentiation (E), ceiling (C), floor (F).
+ A (Advanced Operations): Combining binary or unary operations with variables (a to e).

# Important Notes
+ Make sure to enter valid inputs as per the program's instructions.
+ The program handles division by zero gracefully.
+ When working with variables, ensure you've defined their values using the "V" option.

# Example Usage
Here's a brief example of how to use the program:

1. Choose "B" for binary operations.
2. Select the operation you want to perform (e.g., "+").
3. Enter the first number.
4. Choose whether to use a variable or enter another number.
5. Perform the operation and get the result.
