# Doubly Linked List Program in C
This C program demonstrates the implementation of a doubly linked list. It allows you to perform various operations on the list, including insertion, deletion, printing from both ends, reading from an input file, writing to an output file, and emptying the list.

# Features
+ Insertion: You can insert a new element into the list. The program will maintain the list in ascending order based on the string value of the elements.
+ Deletion: You can delete a specific element from the list based on its string value.
+ Printing: You can print the list in both forward and reverse orders.
+ Reading from Input File: The program can read words from an input file and insert them into the list.
+ Writing to Output File: You can write the contents of the list to an output file.
+ Emptying the List: You can empty the entire list, freeing the allocated memory.

# Usage
1. Compilation: Compile the program using a C compiler, such as GCC.
+ gcc -o main main.c
2. Execution: Run the compiled program.
+ ./main
3. Menu: Follow the on-screen menu to perform different operations on the doubly linked list.
4. Input File: You can provide an input file named "input.txt" with words to be read and inserted into the list.
5. Output File: The program can write the list to an output file named "output.txt."

# Menu Options
The program provides the following menu options:

1. Insert: Insert an element into the list.
2. Delete: Delete an element from the list.
3. Print (Forward): Print the list from the beginning.
4. Print (Reverse): Print the list from the end.
5. Read from File: Read words from "input.txt" and insert them into the list.
6. Write to File: Write the list to "output.txt."
7. Empty List: Empty the list by removing all elements.
8. Exit: Exit the program.

# Example
Here's an example of how you can use the program:

1. Choose option 1 to insert elements into the list.
2. Choose option 3 to print the list from the beginning.
3. Choose option 2 to delete an element.
4. Choose option 3 again to see the updated list.
5. Choose option 5 to read data from an input file (if available).
6. Choose option 6 to write the list to an output file.
7. Choose option 7 to empty the list.
8. Choose option 8 to exit the program.
